The model includes a non-linear current, plus parasitic current and
capacitance (with both bias-dependent and bias-independent components,
for diffused and polysilicon resistors, respectively). Separate end
resistance parameters are included, to allow separate (negative TCR)
self-heating to be applied to these elements.

Instance parameters are:
           w design width  of resistor body
           l design length of resistor body
          wd dogbone width (total; not per side)
          a1 area       of node n1 partition
          p1 perimeter  of node n1 partition
          c1 # contacts at node n1 terminal
          a2 area       of node n2 partition
          p2 perimeter  of node n2 partition
          c2 # contacts at node n2 terminal
       trise local temperature delta to ambient (before self-heating)
    sw_noise switch for including noise:   0=no 1=yes
       sw_et switch for self-heating:      0=no 1=yes
     sw_mman switch for mismatch analysis: 0=no 1=yes
    nsmm_rsh number of standard deviations of mismatch in rsh
      nsmm_w number of standard deviations of mismatch in w
      nsmm_l number of standard deviations of mismatch in l

Contact and end resistance are included via explicit contact
resistances, which scale reciprocally (and in a stepwise, staircase
manner) with c1 and c2, and implicit end resistances that scale
reciprocally (and continuously) with width, through the length offset
xl. Crudely, as the low field resistance is
Ro=(Rc/c1)+rsh*(l+xl)/(w+xw)+(Rc/c2)
and c1 and c2 are roughly proportional to w, the effect of Rc and xl
is similar. As they appear in series in the total resistance,
separation of these terms by using test structures of different lengths
is not possible. Therefore, unless separate characterization of Rc is
available, for devices where contact self-heating is observable (as an
increase in effective conductance with Vds bias, for short resistors)
the electrothermal Rc model should be used. If no contact
electrothermal effects are observable, either the Rc or xl models
could be used, with the difference being discrete or continuous
increase of contact and end region conductance with width. If c1 and
c2 are not available as netlist parameters, they can be calculated as:
c[12]=int((max(w,wc+2*wc2e)-2*wc2e+wc2c)/(wc+wc2c))

  |---------  ===
  |            ^
  |            |  wc2e=contact to contact region edge spacing
  |            v
  |  ----     ===
  |  |  |      ^
  |  |  |      |  wc=contact width
  |  |  |      v
  |  ----     ===
  |            ^
  |            |  wc2c=contact to contact spacing
  |            v
  |  ----     ===
  |  |  |      ^
  |  |  |      |  wc=contact width
  |  |  |      v
  |  ----     ===
  |            ^
  |            |  wc2e=contact to contact region edge spacing
  |            v
  |---------  ===

This follows as the contact region width is
wcr=2*wc2e+nc*wc+(nc-1)*wc2c
and for any resistor, dogbone or not, the minimum wcr is wc+2*wc2e as
there must be at least one contact. This assumes discrete, fixed size
contacts. In older technologies where contacts may scale in the width
direction, c[12] becomes continuous:
c[12]=(max(w,wc+2*wc2e)-2*wc2e)/(wc)
where wc is the minimum contact width and Rc is then the resistance of
a minimum width contact. This contact resistance model is continuous
and is almost the same as the xl model.

Note that c1 and c2 are the number of contacts in the direction
parallel to the width dimension. If extra contacts are place in a
direction parallel to the length dimension, as for reliability for
narrow resistors where only one contact can fit in the width of the
end region, it is assumed that if the contact closest to the
resistor body is not bad, then the majority of the current will flow
through it and not through the back contact, so the contact resistance
will be essentially unchanged from if there is only a single contact,
or row of contacts in the width dimension.

If c1 or c2 is set to zero, it is assumed that there is no contact or
end resistance at that end. This should be used where sections of
r3_cmc are being ganged together and end effects should be removed at
internal nodes. If c1 or c2 is zero, the xl contribution from that end
is removed. Because the difference between TC's for body and end
resistances can be modeled via a 1/length dependence of the TC's, the
effect of c1 and c2 is taken into account in calculating the TC's, to
enable proper ganging together of multiple sections.

In this release of the model, the switch sw_lin is provided to enable
converting the resistor to a simple linear resistor, turning off
depletion pinching, velocity saturation, and self-heating. Depletion
pinching and velocity saturation cannot be turned off by setting their
respective parameters to small values, because the formulations and
solutions are such that they are not numerically well behaved as these
effects reduce to zero. Lower clip limits are therefore enforced for
these parameters.

Compared with version 1.0.0, this version (1.1.0) adds a few items:
- additional parameters for scaling the depletion potential
- options for more accurate pinch-off modeling
- options for improved temperature modeling of velocity saturation

The flicker noise model is set up so that it allows the variation with
current to be controlled by afn, as in normal SPICE models. However the
geometry dependence of 1/f noise is generally not modeled properly
in most circuit simulators. The common kfn*Ids^afn/f^bfn model can be
used for a single geometry. However, considering a single device
as being equivalent to two half length devices in series or two
half width devices in parallel, dictates that the noise current
varies as (Ids/W)^afn*(W/L) and as 1/f noise should vary reciprocally
with area, afn should theoretically only be allowed to be 2.
This fundamental physical geometry scaling is enforced, and it is
recommended that afn=2 be used, experimental data support this.
afn is still provided as a parameter for compatibility with existing
models, and to allow some flexibility in fitting the bias dependence
of 1/f noise. A switch is provided to select between using drawn
or effective dimensions for the geometry dependence.
While pedantically using effective geometries may be
more physical, noise characterization is often done independently of
DC electrical characterization, so weff and leff may not be known when
noise characterization is done. Also, if there is some change in
weff or leff, it may be undesirable to have this significantly change
noise for a device that is already characterized. For these reasons,
the default is that 1/f noise varies with drawn, not effective, geometry.

The basic formulation of the model comes from [1], with enhancements
noted in [2] additional features taken from [7]. The effective width
model is from [3]. The symmetric limiting function used to retain
source-drain symmetry is from [4]. The anomalous increase in
conductance with Vds for some p-body resistors is due to contact
resistance self-heating and negative TC's, this was pointed out in [5].
The restriction on the geometry dependence of the 1/f noise model is
from [6]. The flicker noise formulation adheres to [8].
